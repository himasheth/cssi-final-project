# CSSI Final Project

## What is CSSI?
CSSI is a computer science enrichment summer camp ran by Google Engineers. Throughout the program we learned Javascript through the use of p5.js. We also learned about subjects such as technical writing, resume writing and technical interviews to help us as we embark on our journey as developers in university.

## Our final project
For our final project, we decided to use our knowloedge of p5.js to create various single player games, each a different level of difficulty. We also decided to learn how to use the Google Maps Javascript API and integrate it into our level selection.
